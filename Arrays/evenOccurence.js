/*
Find the first item that occurs an even number of times in an array.
Remember to handle multiple even-occurrence items and return the first one.
Return null if there are no even-occurrence items.

Examples
evenOccurence([ 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 5 ]) // 2
evenOccurence([ "cat", "dog", "dig", "cat" ]) // "cat"
